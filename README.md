THE COOKING COMPASS (My First React Project) 🍽️

This is my first React project, a basic recipe generator that takes user-inputted ingredients and uses the Hugging Face API to generate recipe suggestions. 

Features:
✅ Enter ingredients in an input field
✅ Click "Get Recipe" to fetch a recipe suggestion
✅ Uses Hugging Face AI for recipe generation

Technologies Used
React (UI & state management)
Hugging Face API (AI-powered recipe generation)

Future Improvements:

🔹 Allow users to select dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, keto)
🔹 Add images of generated recipes
🔹 Improve UI/UX with better styling
🔹 Save favorite recipes locally
